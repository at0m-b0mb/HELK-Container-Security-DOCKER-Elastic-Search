# HELK-Container-Security-DOCKER-Elastic-Search

## Project Overview

The HELK-Container-Security-DOCKER-Elastic-Search project is designed to simplify the deployment of the HELK (Hunting ELK) platform in a container environment. HELK is a powerful open-source platform for threat hunting, cybersecurity analysis, and log management. By containerizing it, we aim to make it easier for users to deploy, scale, and manage the HELK stack.
